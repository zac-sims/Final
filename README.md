# Final
This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate pitch prediction models using R and python. If you cannot run Jupyter Notebooks 
on your computer but would still like to view the code, you can go here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zacpdx/Final/master. The file named 
'Pitch Prediction Using R' demonstrates a few different methods of classification while the three notebooks with the title 'Final Project'
go through the workflow of wrangling data, creating a decision tree and random forest, and then evaluating and refining the models. The 
dataset used in each notebook is the greinke_16_17.csv file in the repo. This was downloaded from baseballsavant.mlb.com.
