    "Ulitmately, I belive the features I am working with will have more predictive power when looked at wholeistically. This is why I believe it is ultimately not worth the effort to build the random forest for this case. The tree built with max-depth 20 could give a prediction with an accuracy rate of almost 2% better than just guessing fastball everytime. I belive with even more features the model can become even more accurate. This could be another reason why the random forest is under-performing; there are too little features compared to the amount of data points."
